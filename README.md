# Discord Group Bank Notifications
This is a plugin for RuneLite which sends a message to your discord channel when you or one of your Group Iron Man members deposit or retrieve items from the Group Bank. The message includes what item you deposited or retrieved and the amount (if applicable).

In order to use this plugin you will need to create a webhook on your discord server. Below are instructions for how to do so:
1. Open your Server Settings and head into the Integrations tab
2. Click the "Create Webhook" button to create a new webhook
3. Once created, copy the webhook URL and insert into the "Webhook URL" box in the plugin's configuration in RuneLite.
